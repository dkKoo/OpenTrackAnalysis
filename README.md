OpenTrack Data Analysis
This Python script allows you to analyze and visualize data from multiple CSV files generated by OpenTrack. It provides a convenient way to process the data, calculate statistics, and generate visualizations for both raw and filtered data.

Features
  Loads multiple CSV files using a file selection dialog
  Calculates statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) for raw and filtered data
  Generates 2D and 3D visualizations for each file
  Saves the visualizations as PNG files
  Combines statistics from all files into a single CSV file

Dependencies
  Python 3.x
  pandas
  matplotlib
  tkinter
  
Usage
  Run the script using Python.
  A file selection dialog will appear. Choose the CSV files you want to analyze.
  Select the directory where you want to save the analysis results.
  The script will process each file, calculate statistics, and generate visualizations.
  The visualizations will be saved as PNG files in the selected directory.
  The combined statistics for raw and filtered data will be saved as separate CSV files in the selected directory.

Visualization
  The script generates the following visualizations for each file:
    2D plot: Displays the raw and filtered data for Yaw, Pitch, and Roll over time.
    3D plot (raw data): Displays the raw data in a 3D space with Yaw, Pitch, and Roll as the axes.
    3D plot (filtered data): Displays the filtered data in a 3D space with Yaw, Pitch, and Roll as the axes.

Output
  The script saves the following files in the selected directory:
    <filename>_2d_plot.png: 2D plot for each file
    <filename>_raw_3d_plot.png: 3D plot of raw data for each file
    <filename>_filtered_3d_plot.png: 3D plot of filtered data for each file
    stats_raw_combined.csv: Combined statistics for raw data from all files
    stats_filtered_combined.csv: Combined statistics for filtered data from all files
    
Customization
  You can customize the script according to your specific requirements:
  Modify the sampling rate (sampling_rate) if needed.
  Adjust the figure size and styling of the visualizations.
  Add additional statistics or visualizations as required.
  
Notes
  Make sure the CSV files have the required columns: rawYaw, rawPitch, rawRoll, filteredYaw, filteredPitch, filteredRoll.
  The script assumes a specific format for the CSV files. If your files have a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
  The script uses tkinter for file and directory selection dialogs. If you prefer a different method, you can modify the code to use alternative libraries or provide the file paths and save directory manually.
